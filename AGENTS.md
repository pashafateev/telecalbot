# Agent Workflow

- Commit each completed task before starting the next task.
- Do not batch multiple unrelated tasks into one commit.
- When starting work on a GitHub issue, post a tracking update comment that it is in progress and include the working branch or PR.
- Do not close an issue until the PR that implements it is merged.
- After a PR is merged, close linked issues with a final comment that references the merge commit or merged PR.
