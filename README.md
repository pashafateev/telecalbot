# Telecalbot

A Telegram bot that provides Cal.com booking functionality for users in regions where Cal.com is restricted or blocked.

## Overview

Telecalbot acts as a bridge between Telegram and Cal.com, allowing users to schedule appointments through Telegram messages and buttons. All bookings sync automatically to Google Calendar via Cal.com's existing integration.

## Problem It Solves

Cal.com is blocked in some regions (like Russia), preventing users from accessing the web booking interface. This bot provides the same scheduling functionality through Telegram, which is accessible globally.

## Features

- **Button-Driven Interface**: No command memorization required
- **Timezone Support**: Displays available times in user's timezone (with special support for Russian timezones)
- **Access Control**: Whitelist-based system to manage approved users
- **Google Calendar Sync**: Bookings automatically sync through Cal.com's integration
- **Request-Based Approval**: Admin receives notifications when new users request access

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Telegram Bot Token (from [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather))
- Cal.com API Key
- Cal.com account with Google Calendar integration

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd telecalbot
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.sample .env
   # Edit .env and add your API keys
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Installation instructions coming soon
   ```

4. **Run the bot**

   ```

## Configuration

Required environment variables:
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` - Your Telegram bot token
- `CALCOM_API_KEY` - Your Cal.com API key
- `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` - Your Telegram user ID for admin access

Optional environment variables:
- `CALCOM_PRIVACY_EMAIL` - A dedicated deliverable mailbox Cal.com can use when a user chooses not to provide a personal email. If unset or rejected by Cal.com, the bot explains that private booking is temporarily unavailable and offers the user a voluntary email path.

See `.env.sample` for a complete list of configuration options.

## Development Status
